preflexes
zero operating point of force velocity curve
perturbasion resilience: 

pick muscle with steepest slope (high pennations0


)
cross bridges behavior (not activaiton changes)
chang et al 2009 trained monkey to make rapid endpoint movemens in 1DOF task
put in different patterns of perturbations
fascicle length and moment arms are different



make a cost function(a, the strengths of all muscles, the fast twitch percentages)
so you know when a muscle is forced to use its fast twitch muscle fibers

f0.5 frequency at which you get half of the isometric force. (pulses per second is different for fast and slow twitch muscles)

ask jerry for ankle DOF's with tibialis posterior (small moment arms in both axes)
